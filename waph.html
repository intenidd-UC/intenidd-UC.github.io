        <h3>Web Application Programming and Hacking Course Information</h3>

        <p>This course, We will study basic web application development with front-end (HTML5, JavaScript, CSS) and
            back-end (PHP/MySQL). Web application vulnerabilities and attacks will be introduced and explored with
            hands-on exercises on the range. Secure programming principles and practices will be introduced to avoid
            potential web application vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>

        <p>We have Covered various Labs, handson and Hackathons in ths course</p>
        <h3>Overview of Lab 0</h3>
        <p>TIn Part 1 of the lab, I've set up an Ubuntu virtual machine and installed necessary software like net-tools,
            Sublime Text, Git, Pandoc, Apache 2, Google Chrome, and Wireshark. Moving on to Part 2, I'll clone the
            course repository to my local machine, generate an SSH key, and use it for cloning my private repository
            without entering user credentials for Git actions</p>
        <h3>Overview of Lab 1</h3>
        <p>I learned how to use Wireshark to collect and analyze network traffic in this lab, which helped me become
            more familiar with the HTTP protocol. By using telnet, more investigation into HTTP was done. Transitioning
            to rudimentary web application development, we created CGI web applications in C that enable 1 execution of
            programs on a web server in response toHTTP requests. Task 2 entailed building a simple user-input-accepting
            PHP web application. Understanding HTTP GET and POST requests—which are essential for enabling data transfer
            between clients and servers—was the focus of the last assignment. To sum up, the lab covered using
            Wireshark, comprehending HTTP, creating CGI, and programming PHP, offering a useful introduction of web
            technologies and networking principles.</p>
        <h3>Overview of Lab 2</h3>
        <p>The lab consists of two tasks. In the first section, I created a basic HTML page with JavaScript and forms.
            The integration of Ajax, CSS, jQuery, and Web API is the focus of Task 2. I attentively followed the
            directions provided in the lecture slides, consulting the recordings of the class for clarification. The
            Sublime Text Editor was used to complete the entire lab in a virtual machine environment.</p>
        <h3>Overview of Hackathon 1</h3>
        <p>Participating in the hackathon entails doing practical tasks that are described in Lectures 7-8. Cross-site
            scripting assaults are carried out at different levels in order to identify vulnerabilities and investigate
            protection systems. Participants finish the hacking exercise by completing the lecture activities by
            following the directions.</p>
